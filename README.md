# FlightBookingWeb

1. Description: Built a full-stack flight booking web application that enables users to search, book, and manage flight tickets with real-time data. The system supports user authentication, role-based access (admin/user), dynamic flight filtering, booking history, and admin management tools.

2. Key Features:

   - Frontend developed with ReactJS and styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS for a responsive, user-friendly interface.
   - Backend implemented with Spring Boot, exposing RESTful APIs for handling flights, users, and bookings.
   - User authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Token).
   - MySQL used for persistent data storage, with optimized database schema for flight schedules and reservations.
   - Admin panel to manage flights, view bookings, and update system data.
   - Validation, error handling, and feedback integrated across the system.

3. Result: The project was completed with all core features implemented and tested locally. It demonstrated a complete flow from user authentication to flight booking and admin management. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in integrating a ReactJS frontend with a Spring Boot backend, designing RESTful APIs, implementing JWT-based security, and working with relational databases. It also improved my understanding of fullstack application structure, data validation, and user experience design.
